The source codes are in chatbot directory.

First, run pre_process.py to pre_process the corpus. The result will be save in data directory.

In fact, we have already pre-processed the corpus.

Then, if you want to compare the different models, just run evaluation.py.

If you want to interact with this stupid chatbot, jusr run interface.py.
